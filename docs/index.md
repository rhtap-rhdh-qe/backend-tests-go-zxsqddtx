# Trusted Application Pipeline Software Template

This application, **backend-tests-go-zxsqddtx**, was created from a Trusted Application Pipeline Software Template.

The software templates create a new source and gitops deployment repositories with a sample source application. 

## Repositories

The gitops repository, which contains the kubernetes manifests for the application can be found in 
[https://github.com/rhtap-rhdh-qe/backend-tests-go-zxsqddtx-gitops ](https://github.com/rhtap-rhdh-qe/backend-tests-go-zxsqddtx-gitops )
